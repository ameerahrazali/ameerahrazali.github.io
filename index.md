# 👋 Hi, I'm Ameerah

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92135269?s=400&u=31d020baab290a4bcf0196685a401b5dc33bf869&v=4" width="120" alt="Ameerah Razali profile photo" align="right" />

**Always learning, always becoming.**

Welcome to my data portfolio!

I'm a Statistics graduate with a specialization in Big Data Analytics, passionate about turning raw data into meaningful narratives. Whether it’s modeling inflation trends, exploring public sentiment, or visualizing patterns in music and crime, I enjoy solving real-world problems through data.

I’m especially drawn to:
- 📊 **Data storytelling** that brings insights to life  
- 🧠 **Statistical modeling** for forecasts and decisions  
- 💡 **Process improvement** powered by evidence  
- 🔎 Exploring the human side of data through **sentiment & behavioral analysis**

I have a growing interest in **data science**, particularly in applying **machine learning** to understand complex systems and drive better decisions. I'm constantly exploring new tools and techniques to deepen my skillset.

My current toolkit includes **R**, **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Markdown/HTML**. I believe in clean visuals, reproducible work, and making data accessible to all.
